# Navigating Demand Uncertainty in Container Shipping: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enabling Adaptive and Feasible Master Stowage Planning

## Overview
This repository contains supplementary code for our double-blind submission to IJCAI 2025.

## Submission Guidelines
To ensure compliance with double-blind review requirements, we have taken the following measures:
- **Author identities are not disclosed** anywhere in the code or associated files.
- **Metadata in scripts and documentation** has been scrubbed of personal information.
- **Code comments and version control history** do not contain author-identifying information.

## Running the Code
To execute the supplementary code, ensure the config files are correctly set up. Then, use the following instructions:
```sh
python main.py  # Modify based on actual usage
```
Ensure that any required dependencies are installed using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Reproducibility
To facilitate reproducibility while maintaining anonymity, we:
- Provide necessary scripts with minimal setup.
- Avoid hard-coded paths linked to personal systems.
